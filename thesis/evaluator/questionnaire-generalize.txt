there once was a man from great britain
who interrupted two girls at their knittin
said he with a sigh     
that park bench well i
just painted it right where youre sittin

there was a farmer from leeds
who ate six packets of seeds
it soon came to pass    
he was covered with grass
and he couldnt sit down for the weeds

every day hermits larry and linc
would debate what a hermit should think
paraphrasing descartes  
theyd agree at the start
we undoubtedly are for we stink

leeds prodigy heaviest beard
drawl temper pricked practicing feared
shade squirrel regal train     
bent barge pedal rain
don¹t dead underdone rubber beard

mall froze notion worked fuss it stammered
thump spied underdone entered covered
man cannister fishing   
cash party left fishing
as days beau exceedingly withered

man brutus isoceles conduct
upon hermit radical conduct
near funeral plenty     
perhaps roar since seventy
out pants plenty shoe extinct conduct
